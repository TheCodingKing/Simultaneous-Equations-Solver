# Simultaneous-Equations-Solver
Simple tool to solve systems of equations

**Requirements**
- Numpy (for solving using matrices)
- String (native Python module)

**How it works**
- Matrices can be used to solve systems of equations
- By multiplying the inverse of a matrix of coefficients by a vector of constants, a resultant vector (n x 1) will contain values corresponding to each variable

**Limitations**
- Only supports three variables at the moment
